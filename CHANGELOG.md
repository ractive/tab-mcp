## @ractive-ch/tab-mcp-client

### [0.1.0-alpha.0] - unreleased

First alpha of the browser library, on the npm dist-tag `alpha`.

#### Added

- `TabMcp`: register tools WebMCP-style (`registerTool` with JSON Schema input, annotations
  and an abort signal), connect to a tab-mcp relay and answer MCP requests in the page.
- A small core; `connect()` loads the connection and the dialogs on demand.
- Default dialogs: "Connect your AI tool" with the address and connected apps, and a
  confirmation for consequential tools.
- ESM build for bundlers with type declarations, and a self-contained build for
  `<script type="module">` under `@ractive-ch/tab-mcp-client/cdn`.

[0.1.0-alpha.0]: https://github.com/ractive/tab-mcp/releases/tag/client-v0.1.0-alpha.0
